# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (2016-07-26)

This update is mainly moving source files into a `src` directory. The main theme files that Drupal needs are left in the top level theme folder. If you try to move them, stuff breaks.

### New Feature
* Added editor config file. http://editorconfig.org/
* Moved source files into a new `/src` directory.

### Documentation
* Added a new CHANGELOG.md! YAY!
